# Introduction 

The growing India needs the development of the dierentially abled people. Our project
aims at building a comprehensive system which helps the visually impaired people to acquire
the knowledge of the book. The project concept is to use the voice signal processing to detect
the input speech using a speech recognition system and accordingly carryout the operations
such as NEXT, PREVIOUS or READ. NEXT and PREVIOUS operations are used to turn
the page of a book in the forward or backward direction respectively. READ operation makes
use of Digital image processing to read out the content of a page.
The software part has been implemented using open source software and a low cost
and durable hardware. The whole of the project can be implemented at a very low cost and
according to the standards of the current generation. This project can be installed in libraries
to help the blind to read the books without the help of others.
